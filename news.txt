=== 2020-10-01 - Second release candidate released

Thanks to all the community testing we fixed some bugs :)

As there are several changes still around we decided to make a second release candidate:
https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/releases/tag/v20.09-rc.2[v20.09-rc.2].

Use the git tag `v20.09-rc.2` for testing in your feeds configuration:
```
src-git libremesh https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages.git;v20.09-rc.2
```

=== 2020-09-18 - A release candidate for the next release!

Although the LibreMesh development never stopped, it was since the 17.06
"Dayboot Rely" release that we didn't have an _official_ release.
The goal is to have the **final release at the beginning of November**.

This means that the release candidate needs testing, bug fixing and
loads of community love so that we can have an amazing release that can
actually ease the creation of community networks everywhere.

for more detailed information.

Within this years https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[GSoC] a fellow student tries to setup a new way to perform sysupgrades on LibreMesh Routers (and LEDE/OpenWrt in general).
The idea is to generate sysupgrade images on demand with all manually installed packages included.
